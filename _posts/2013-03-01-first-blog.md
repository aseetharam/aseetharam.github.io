My plan is to update this blog about everything that I find interesting. Since I work as bioinformatician I mostly update this blog about my experiences with working with some projects, some tips and tricks or even some programs and scripts! If you are a biologist working with NGS data, you might actually like it :)

I might also update things like:

1. Highlights of research papers that I read.
2. Experience using some programs/software packages related to bioinformatics
3. Anything of scientific interest
4. Personal life stories.

I will soon update my blog!

Thanks! Stay tuned.
