One useful feature in bash is that you can recall previously used commands (using arrow keys). You can also recursively search your history by pressing `Ctrl + r` and typing the command name, which brings up the matching commands. It will also lets you cycle through all matching commands by pressing `Ctrl + r` repeatedly. This is only helpful, if your history file is big. By default, `$HISTFILE` holds only limited number of entries (1000 lines or commands). You can easily hack it, so that you can store unlimited number of entries. Simply follow these steps:
First, in your `.bashrc` file, set these variables

```bash
export HISTFILESIZE=
export HISTSIZE=
export HISTFILE=~/.bash_eternal_history
```

This will make your history file unlimited! Other useful feature that you can use is setting `$HISTTIMEFORMAT` variable. This will write time stamps in the history file, marked with the history comment character, so they may be preserved across shell sessions.

```bash
export HISTTIMEFORMAT="[%F %T] "
```

Now start making aÂ never ending history!
