## About Me

I am a bioinformatics scientist at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/)'s, [Rosen Center for Advanced Computing](https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/), offering bioinformatics support to researchers at Purdue and beyond. My work spans comparative genomics, genome assembly, single-cell RNA sequencing, and bioinformatics software development. I collaborate with researchers to provide computational expertise and drive data-driven discoveries in various biological systems.

My professional journey has been dedicated to genomics and evolutionary genetics, with a particular focus on next and third-generation sequencing technologies. I have developed pipelines for genome assembly, annotation, and structural variation analysis, simplifying the complexities of genomics.

Previously, I held a joint appointment as a Research Scientist in the Departments of Ecology, Evolution, and Organismal Biology (EEOB), and Genetics, Development, and Cell Biology (GDCB) at Iowa State University. I also contributed as an Associate Scientist at the Genome Informatics Facility (GIF), enriching my expertise in bioinformatics.

My current collaborations include various faculty/researchers at Purdue University, and with [Matthew Hufford](http://www.zeagenomics.org/) (EEOB) at Iowa State University, [MaizeGDB](https://www.maizegdb.org/) (USDA-ARS, Ames). I am passionate about studying genome organization and evolution, particularly in grass species.
