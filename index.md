I am a bioinformatician and my main interests are in the fields of genomics and evolutionary genetics. Currently, I am working on various projects involving next & third generation sequencing including genome assemblies, annotation, and identification of structural variation. I am also  developing pipelines to streamline the assembly and annotation process for newly sequenced organisms. My long-term goal is to study the genome organization and evolution of grass species.

I am jointly appointed as Research Scientist by the [Department of Ecology, Evolution, and Organismal Biology (EEOB)](https://www.eeob.iastate.edu) and [Genetics, Development, and Cell Biology (GDCB)](https://www.gdcb.iastate.edu)). Previously, I worked as Associate Scientist at [Genome Informatics Facility (GIF)](https://gif.biotech.iastate.edu/).

 I am currently collaborating with [Matthew Hufford](http://www.zeagenomics.org/) from Department of Ecology, Evolution, and Organismal Biology (EEOB), and [Geetu Tuteja](https://www.tutejalab.org/) both from Department of Genetics, Development, and Cell Biology at Iowa State University, Ames, IA.
