Greetings! I'm a passionate bioinformatician with a keen focus on the captivating realms of genomics and evolutionary genetics. My professional journey is dedicated to unraveling the secrets encoded within the genetic makeup of life forms. At present, my efforts are channeled into a variety of projects that revolve around the intricate world of next and third generation sequencing. This includes pioneering work in genome assemblies, precise annotations, and the discernment of structural variations.

My commitment extends to developing cutting-edge pipelines that facilitate the seamless assembly and annotation of freshly sequenced organisms. I'm motivated by the desire to simplify the complexities of genomics and make the process accessible to all.

My ultimate aspiration centers around an ambitious exploration: the study of genome organization and evolution within the vibrant realm of grass species. As a testament to my dedication, I am honored to hold a joint appointment as a Research Scientist, serving both the [Department of Ecology, Evolution, and Organismal Biology (EEOB)](https://www.eeob.iastate.edu) and the [Genetics, Development, and Cell Biology (GDCB)](https://www.gdcb.iastate.edu).

In a previous chapter of my journey, I had the privilege of contributing as an Associate Scientist at the [Genome Informatics Facility (GIF)](https://gif.biotech.iastate.edu/), a role that further enriched my knowledge and experience.

Currently, I am engaged in inspiring collaborations with esteemed individuals such as [Matthew Hufford](http://www.zeagenomics.org/) from the Department of Ecology, Evolution, and Organismal Biology (EEOB), and [Geetu Tuteja](https://www.tutejalab.org/) from the Department of Genetics, Development, and Cell Biology at Iowa State University, Ames, IA.

For those curious to explore, my website's [resources](https://aseetharam.github.io/workshops) section showcases a selection of my impactful contributions. Join me in unraveling the genetic tapestry that underlies life's diversity â€“ it's a journey that promises endless fascination and discovery.
