Our work has also been highlighted by various online news journals, showing its importance for the general public. Here are some of the samples:

1.	**September 18, 2015:** _“Researchers are developing genomic resources for Seriola dorsalis to improve the brood stock selection of yellowtail kingfish for grow-out. Courtesy of Hubbs-Seaworld Research Institute”_ [**read more...**](https://www.rdmag.com/article/2015/09/so-many-people-so-little-food-helping-feed-world-through-genomics)

2.	**Fall 2017:** _“Commercial abalone “aquaculture”—farming the shellfish in enclosures—has exploded over the past decade, becoming a $100-million global industry. Understanding the DNA of the abalone is key to improving and expanding its aquaculture for California producers. That’s why scientists at Iowa State University and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration worked with PSC experts to “assemble” the DNA sequences of several species of abalone on the Bridges supercomputer”_ [**read more...**](https://www.psc.edu/abalonedna)

3.	**November 14, 2017:** _“To improve and expand business operations, scientists at Iowa State University and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) worked with the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center (PSC) experts to assemble the DNA sequences of several species of abalone on the Bridges supercomputer”_ [**read more...**](https://sciencenode.org/feature/Bridges%20helps%20preserve%20abalone%20species.php)

4.	**November 14, 2017:** _Next-generation agriculture requires immense computing power. Learn how supercomputing and bioinformatics will help scientists adapt agricultural practices to feed 9 billion people_ [**read more...**](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/insights/articles/agricultural-genomics-feeding-a-growing-hungry-world-1711.html)

5. **April 11, 2018:** _“If you eat fish in the U.S., chances are it once swam in or near another country. That's because the U.S. imports over 80 percent of its seafood, according to estimates by the United Nations. New genetic research could help make farmed fish more palatable and bring America's wild fish species to dinner tables. Scientists have used big data and supercomputers to catch a fish genome, a first step in its sustainable aquaculture harvest”_ [**read more...**](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/04/180411131705.htm)

8. **May 21, 2020:** _“Teachers make genomes more useful… from home: Imagine a book written with all the right words, but no spaces between words, no punctuation, no chapter headings—it would look like a senseless string of letters one after the other. That is what the first draft of a genome sequence looks like.”_ [**read more...**](https://www.cshl.edu/teachers-make-genomes-more-useful-from-home/)
